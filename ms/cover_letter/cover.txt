To the editor,

We are submitting our manuscript, "Effects of Epidemiological Structure on the Transient Evolution of HIV Virulence", for consideration for publication in \emph{PLoS Computational Biology}. Using HIV as a model system, our study explores the transient, eco-evolutionary changes in pathogen characteristics over the course of an epidemic. Building on modeling frameworks and estimated parameters developed by \cite{shirreff_transmission_2011} and \cite{champredon_hiv_2013}, we ask how predicted changes in virulence depend on way that contact patterns (e.g. the dynamics of sexual partnership change and contact outside of stable partnerships) are modeled.

This study is important because modelers are actively publishing studies that predict the evolutionary consequences of public-health interventions \cite{payne_impact_2014,roberts2015impact,herbeck2016evolution}. Our paper suggests that these studies, which generally focus on the within-host and evolutionary properties of the pathogen but neglect important epidemiological structure, should be interpreted with caution.
