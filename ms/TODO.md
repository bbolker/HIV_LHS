# Second revision/resubmission

- somewhere in discussion, comment on initial state of virulence (unknown; zoonosis has unpredictable effects on initial virulence ...)
- **BMB finish writing/responding!**
- figures:
    - make augmented violin plots with points for baseline runs, baseline+vital dynamics, baseline+heterogeneity
- explain new version of Figure 5

- "We look at the graph and we think we can make up some stories about what's going on; they make sense to us, but we haven't tested them."
- for parameters involved in partnership turnover ($c$ and $\rho$), main distinction is between models with and without epc; with epc we get gradual decrease in peak time/maximum SPVL/eq SPVL with increasing *turnover rate, otherwise we get increases. Increased turnover will diminish effect of epc (equivalently increases relative importance of within-partnership contact). For models without epc, increased rates of partnership change decrease the level of structured mixing (e.g., as *turnover becomes large we get to the random mixing limit anyway).
- once we scale, the outcome statistics (?) are insensitive to several of the parameters ($\kappa$ etc.); (copy previous explanation)
- transmission and duration: (beta, D for other models ...) gradual decrease for all models

- distinguishes between implicit and pairform, in effects of $c$
- range of parameters is compressed (relative to other models) for models without epc -- need to e.g. crank $c$ way up to achieve a given $r$. Range for random-mixing models is severely compressed (there's only 1 way to achieve a given $r$)


- implement vital dynamics, for real this time
