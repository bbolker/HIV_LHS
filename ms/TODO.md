# Second revision/resubmission

- in discussion: comment on initial state of virulence (unknown; zoonosis has unpredictable effects on initial virulence ...)?

- new figure 1 (diagram):
   - fix arrow colours
   - we describe models in order d,c,b,a in main text. Is this a problem (I don't think so)?
   - change to use LaTeX subfigure environment (i.e., labels will be a better size)
   - add labels ("pairform+epc" etc.) to subfigure captions

- describe heterog, vital dynamics results in Discussion
- finish responding to reviewers/editor

- finish Figure 3 aug
   - add time to progression
   - I think I messed this up by redefining the parameter order? (However it happened, current figure is messed up)
   - in R/ev_hetero.R, add model
   - where is the code for fig3_aug ... ???
