# Second revision/resubmission

- somewhere in discussion, comment on initial state of virulence (unknown; zoonosis has unpredictable effects on initial virulence ...)- BMB finish writing/responding!
- figures:
    - adjust grids as we see fit
	- replace peak-to-eq ratio with min progression time in Fig 3?
	- fig 4: fuss with axis labels, expression(), etc.


- why are we using unscaled params in Figure 5? remake scaled version
- consider implementing vital dynamics; e.g. assume 50 year sexually active lifespan
- consider (????) adding heterogeneity to other models (i.e. turn off epc, accelerate pair-formation)
