- in Figure 3: what is causing the tail of very low eq virulence/long eq progression times?
- Figure 3: is aspect ratio right or do we want to make it a little narrower (i.e. smaller fig.width) ?
- Figure 4: too much space between labels and axes?  units?
- Figure 5: fix x, y-axis label collisions.
  column labels: add short verbal descriptions???
  
- BMB: look at Appendix
- BMB: go through paper again; het stuff in discussion
