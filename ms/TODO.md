# PLoS CB resubmission (deadline: 28 Oct, aiming for 21 Oct)

- re-draw figures as appropriate
   - fig 2-5 substitute progression time for SPVL; explain at beginning of Results that we're switching (recompute relative time based on 
   - fig 2: collapse pairs into single facets?
   - fig 3, 4: add one category
   - fig 5: combine {beta, D} params (pick one and explain that they're all similar), add CV^2 of mixing rate and mean of mixing rate
- BMB: discuss/add stuff if necessary to description of heterogeneity
- BMB: emphasize that Fig 1 establishes that we haven't lost too much by
collapsing to a single-state disease model. Where do we introduce it?
Add brief description of $r$ (and ref to main text section) in Fig 1 caption
- BMB: look at Appendix
- BMB: how consistent are we talking about SPVL as "virulence"?
It's really "host exploitation". (Check 'strain' vs 'SPVL')
- (DP) check equations to references (in supplement) [equation -> model]
- make sure to refer to
