- make sure DP is first; change affiliation
- cover letter
- other examples? (recent lit search)
- figures vs. poster:
    - remove legends in figs 2,3 
	- units in y-axis figs 2.1,2.2 (/year)
    - figure 2: y-axis "mean set-point viral load (log[10])"
- virulence -> exploitation?
- add figures (2.1, 2.2, 3.1) to supplementary material; mention in main text
