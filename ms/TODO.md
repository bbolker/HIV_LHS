# PLoS CB resubmission (deadline: 28 Oct, aiming for 21 Oct)

- in Figure 3: what is causing the tail of very low eq virulence/long eq progression times? done
- Figure 3: is aspect ratio right or do we want to make it a little narrower (i.e. smaller fig.width) ? I think it's OK as it is.
- Figure 4: too much space between labels and axes?  units? still needs to be fixed
- Figure 5: fix x, y-axis label collisions. done
  column labels: add short verbal descriptions??? wouldn't that make the plot too crowded?
  
- BMB: look at Appendix
- BMB: go through paper again; het stuff in discussion
- BMB: responses to reviewers
