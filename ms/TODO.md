   - fig 2: collapse pairs into single facets?
   - fig 3, 4: add one category
   - fig 5: combine {beta, D} params (pick one and explain that they're all similar), add CV^2 of mixing rate and mean of mixing rate
- BMB: discuss/add stuff if necessary to description of heterogeneity
- Add brief description of $r$ (and ref to main text section) in Fig 1 caption
- BMB: look at Appendix
- BMB: how consistent are we talking about SPVL as "virulence"?

- (DP) check equations to references (in supplement) [equation -> model]
- check Kretszchmar, Dietz & Hadeler refs to see that we're citing them correctly
- Figures:
    - use line types as well as colours in fig 1
