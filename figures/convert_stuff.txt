with imagemagick:

identify <filename>

> identify fig1.tif
fig1.tif TIFF 12000x4200 12000x4200+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 1.608MB 0.000u 0:00.000

so this is 12000x4200 pixels.  

We can convert images to TIFF at a specified dpi (300 in this case) via:

convert -density 300 <filename>.png <filename>.tif

but that doesn't actually do anything because PNGs don't really have a physical size ...

http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/#geometry

-resize xx%
-resize (pixelsize)x(pixelsize)

but it might be easiest to set the resolution to whatever PLoS wants it to be in figures.rmd;
then we just need "convert <filename>.png <filename>.tif"
